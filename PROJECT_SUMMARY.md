# Symptomps AI - Project Summary

## What We've Built (Current State)

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Next.js App Setup** with Tailwind CSS
2. **PWA Support** - App can be installed on mobile devices
3. **Custom Components**:
   - `SymptomTracker.js` - Add, edit, delete symptoms with severity levels
   - `ProgressView.js` - Statistics and recent activity overview
   - `AIInsights.js` - AI-powered recommendations (currently mock data)
   - `Navigation.js` - Mobile-friendly tab navigation
4. **Local Storage** - Data persists between sessions
5. **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive UI that works on phones

### ðŸ“± App Structure
- **Track Symptoms Tab**: Add symptoms with name, severity (1-5), date, notes
- **Progress Tab**: View stats, recent activity, most common symptoms
- **AI Insights Tab**: Get recommendations based on tracked data
- **Settings Tab**: Export data, clear all data

### ðŸ”§ Technical Stack
- Next.js 15.3.4
- Tailwind CSS
- next-pwa (PWA support)
- Local Storage for data persistence

## Next Steps (To Do)

### ðŸš€ Immediate Improvements
1. **Real LLM Integration** - Connect to OpenAI API for actual AI insights
2. **Data Export** - Implement CSV/JSON export functionality
3. **Symptom Templates** - Pre-defined templates for different conditions (IBS, allergies, etc.)
4. **Charts/Visualizations** - Add graphs to show symptom trends over time

### ðŸ”® Future Features
1. **User Authentication** - Multi-user support
2. **Cloud Sync** - Database integration (Firebase/Supabase)
3. **Medication Tracking** - Track medications alongside symptoms
4. **Healthcare Provider Integration** - Share data with doctors
5. **Smart Notifications** - Reminders to track symptoms
6. **Predictive Analysis** - AI predicts symptom patterns

## Development Notes

### Current Issues to Fix
- PWA icons need proper PNG files (currently placeholder text)
- next.config.mjs has some warnings about unrecognized keys

### Files Created
- `components/SymptomTracker.js` - Main symptom tracking interface
- `components/ProgressView.js` - Progress and statistics view
- `components/AIInsights.js` - AI recommendations component
- `components/Navigation.js` - Tab navigation
- `app/page.js` - Main app page with tab switching
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `next.config.mjs` - PWA configuration

### How to Continue
1. The app is running at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Network URL for mobile testing: `http://192.168.100.77:3000`
3. All data is stored in browser's localStorage
4. Components are modular and ready for enhancement

## Conversation Context
This project was built through an AI-assisted development session. The conversation covered:
- Initial project setup and PWA configuration
- Building custom React components for symptom tracking
- Implementing mobile-first responsive design
- Setting up local data persistence
- Creating mock AI insights (ready for real LLM integration)
